# Magic-Destroyers-Game-CS
A simulation game where two teams (Melee and Caster) will fight until one team is victorious. 

This project was written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio for an online course. It is less of a game and more of a familiarisation exercise with C# syntax and conventions. Due to this, there is no real balance in the game since the only real difference between the classes is their base health points/ability points. Subsequently, many areas of the game are not fleshed out, for example the armour classes are all the same even though someone wearing mail armour should take less damage than someone wearing cloth. These areas haven't been addressed since designing a balanced game wasn't the intention of this project, though I may come back to it in the future.
